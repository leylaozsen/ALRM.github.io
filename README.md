# Welcome to Applied Linear Regression Models 

Here you will find the R Code and supplementary Excel files for the book titled "Applied Linear Regression Models" by Kutner, Nachtsheim and Neter. All page numbers for the examples are based on the *4th edition* of the Applied Linear Regression Models (ALRM) book.

Data sets for each chapter of ALRM 4th edition can be accessed at this link: www.cnachtsheim-text.csom.umn.edu. You may want to bookmark this link because we will reference it below. 

## Chapter 1

### Toluca Company Example on Page 19

The data set for this example can be found under Chapter 1 files and is titled "CH01TA01". And of course, since the first rule of Statistics is to always plot the data, that's where we will start. Here are two R-scripts that will allow you to create a scatter plot for the Toluca Example. 



The first script uses base R. The second script uses the Tidyverse pacakge in R. See
